# Mini Project 1 - Vechile Main Menu Simulation

This project is a simple console-based application that simulates a vehicle system. The application allows the user to control the vehicle's engine, air conditioning, traffic light, room temperature, and engine temperature. The application also displays the current state of the vehicle.

The application is menu-driven, i.e. the user is presented with a menu of options from which they can choose. The user can choose to:

- Turn on or off the vehicle's engine
- Set the traffic light color
- Set the room temperature
- Set the engine temperature (if the engine temperature controller is on)
- Quit the application

The application displays the current state of the vehicle, including the status of the engine, air conditioning, traffic light, room temperature, and engine temperature.
